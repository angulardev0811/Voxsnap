<itunes:summary>The latest Global Ad Trends report from the World Advertising Research Center (WARC) states, &amp;ldquo;successful brands allocate an average 13% of their media budget to out of home.&amp;rdquo; Since reading the report, I have been interested in understanding more about these successful brands. Who are they and why do they buck the 6% average adspend in Out of Home?&amp;nbsp; How do they use OOH to strategically position their products and services? Most importantly, why should we pay attention to the trend?</itunes:summary>

<itunes:subtitle>What is Experiential Marketing?</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>It goes by a lot of names&amp;hellip;. &amp;ldquo;experiential marketing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;event marketing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;on-ground marketing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;live marketing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;participation marketing&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;special events&amp;rdquo;. But no matter what name people use, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that there is one thing experiential marketing is, and that&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;confusing. Experiential is still a (relatively) new channel, and it&amp;rsquo;s continuing to develop before our eyes. The addition of smart phones into the mix is adding a dimension to an already rapidly changing media.&amp;nbsp; So, it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that people can be confused when it comes to what&amp;rsquo;s involved in experiential.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>What is Out of Home Media?
Well…..Billboards right? There… that was easy.  Hold up, not so fast …
When we talk to advertisers that are new to the Out of Home advertising category, that is frequently the answer we get – and with good reason.  Billboards are the largest, most prominent, most widely recognized part of the Out of Home media landscape, and it’s natural for people to focus on them.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>On July 1, 1941 before the broadcast of a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies (Go Phils!) Bulova watches ran the first official, paid television advertisement in the U.S. (they paid between $4.00 and $9.00, reports vary), and advertising experienced a paradigm shift as screens became the most important media format.

Now before you close this article out and laugh about it with your colleagues, results from recent studies from Nielsen and Omnicom’s Benchmarketing show that billboards and bus shelters and the rest of the OOH media world should be playing a much larger role in your brand’s media spends.</itunes:summary>
