          <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
          <h3>1. Your Acceptance</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              By using or visiting the VoxSnap website or any VoxSnap products, software, data feeds, and
              services provided to you on, from, or through the VoxSnap website (collectively the "Service")
              you signify your agreement to (1) these terms and conditions (the "Terms of Service"), (2)
              VoxSnap's Privacy Policy, found at <a href="https://voxsnap.com/privacy/">https://voxsnap.com/privacy/</a> and incorporated herein by
              reference. If you do not agree to any of these terms, the VoxSnap Privacy Policy, please do
              not use the Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of
              Service, you should periodically review the most up-to-date version
              <a href="https://voxsnap.com/terms/">https://voxsnap.com/terms/</a>.
              VoxSnap may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these
              Terms of Service and policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications
              or revisions. Nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to confer any third-party
              rights or benefits.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>2. Service</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Service, including users who are also
              contributors of Content on the Service. “Content” includes the text, software, scripts, graphics,
              photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive features and other
              materials you may view on, access through, or contribute to the Service. The Service includes
              all aspects of VoxSnap, including but not limited to all products, software and services
              offered via the VoxSnap website, such as the VoxSnap "Embeddable Player," the VoxSnap
              "Narration Uploader" and other applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by
              VoxSnap. VoxSnap has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content,
              privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, VoxSnap will not and
              cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly
              relieve VoxSnap from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.
            </li>
            <li>
              Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms
              and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit.
            </li>
            <li>
              VoxSnap may change the price for any of the services and will communicate any price changes to you in advance.
              Price changes for subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date
              of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the VoxSnap Service
              after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the
              change by unsubscribing from the VoxSnap Service prior to the price change going into effect.
              Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>3. VoxSnap Accounts</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In order to access some features of the Service, you will have to create a VoxSnap Account.
              You may never use another's account without permission. When creating your account, you
              must provide complete and accurate information. You are solely responsible for the activity
              that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must
              notify VoxSnap immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
            </li>
            <li>
              Although VoxSnap will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your
              account, you may be liable for the losses of VoxSnap or others due to such unauthorized use.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>4. General Use of the Service: Permissions and Restrictions</h3>
          <p>
            VoxSnap hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these
            Terms of Service, provided that:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              You agree not to distribute in any medium any part of the Service or the Content without VoxSnap's
              prior written authorization, unless VoxSnap makes available the means for such distribution through
              functionality offered by the Service (such as the Embeddable Player).
            </li>
            <li>
              You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the audio playback pages of
              the Service itself, the Embeddable Player, or other explicitly authorized means VoxSnap may designate.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you use the Embeddable Player on your website, you may not modify, build upon, or block any portion or
              functionality of the Embeddable Player, including but not limited to links back to the VoxSnap website.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you use the VoxSnap Narration Uploader, you agree that it may automatically download and install updates
              from time to time from VoxSnap. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop
              the Narration Uploader and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules and completely
              new versions. You agree to receive such updates (and permit VoxSnap to deliver these to you) as part of your use of
              the Narration Uploader.
            </li>
            <li>
              You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots", "spiders" or "offline readers"
              that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the VoxSnap servers in a given period of time than
              a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
              VoxSnap grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for
              the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials,
              but not caches or archives of such materials. VoxSnap reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally
              or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names,
              from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service (e.g., comments, email) for any commercial
              solicitation purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Service with respect to their Content.
            </li>
            <li>
              In your use of the Service, you will comply with all applicable laws.
            </li>
            <li>
              VoxSnap reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>5. Your Use of Content</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to the general restrictions above, the following restrictions and
            conditions apply specifically to your use of Content.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The Content on the Service, and the trademarks, service marks and logos ("Marks") on the Service, are owned by or licensed to VoxSnap,
              subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under the law.
            </li>
            <li>
              Content is provided to you AS IS. You may access Content for your information and personal use solely as intended through the provided
              functionality of the Service and as permitted under these Terms of Service. You shall not download any Content unless you see a “download”
              or similar link displayed by VoxSnap on the Service for that Content. You shall not copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display,
              sell, license, or otherwise exploit any Content for any other purposes without the prior written consent of VoxSnap or the respective licensors
              of the Content. VoxSnap and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted in and to the Service and the Content.
            </li>
            <li>
              You agree not to circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Service or features that prevent or
              restrict use or copying of any Content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the Content therein.
            </li>
            <li>
              You understand that when using the Service, you will be exposed to Content from a variety of sources, and that VoxSnap is not responsible for
              the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Content. You further understand and acknowledge that
              you may be exposed to Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or
              equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against VoxSnap with respect thereto, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, agree to
              indemnify and hold harmless VoxSnap, its owners, operators, affiliates, licensors, and licensees to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding
              all matters related to your use of the Service.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>6. Your Content and Conduct</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              As a VoxSnap account holder you may submit Content to the Service, including audio narration and user comments. You understand that VoxSnap
              does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any Content you submit.
            </li>
            <li>
              You shall be solely responsible for your own Content and the consequences of submitting and publishing your Content on the Service. You affirm,
              represent, and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to publish Content you submit; and you
              license to VoxSnap all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to such Content for publication on the
              Service pursuant to these Terms of Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. However, by submitting Content to VoxSnap, you hereby grant VoxSnap a worldwide,
              non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform
              the Content in connection with the Service and VoxSnap's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and
              redistributing part or all of the Service(and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each
              user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such Content
              as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under these Terms of Service. The above licenses granted by you in audio Content you submit to the
              Service terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete your audio content from the Service. You understand and agree, however,
              that VoxSnap may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted. The above licenses granted by
              you in user comments you submit are perpetual and irrevocable.
            </li>
            <li>
              You further agree that Content you submit to the Service will not contain third party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third party
              proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to
              grant VoxSnap all of the license rights granted herein.
            </li>
            <li>
              VoxSnap does not endorse any Content submitted to the Service by any user or other licensor, or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein,
              and VoxSnap expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with Content. VoxSnap does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of
              intellectual property rights on the Service, and VoxSnap will remove all Content if properly notified that such Content infringes on another's intellectual
              property rights. VoxSnap reserves the right to remove Content without prior notice.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>7. Ownership</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Ownership and limitations: When the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the buyer is granted all intellectual property rights, including but not limited to,
              copyrights for the work delivered from the seller, and the seller waives any and all moral rights therein. The delivered work shall be considered work-for-hire under
              the U.S. Copyright Act. In the event the delivered work does not meet the requirements of work-for-hire or when US Copyright Act does not apply, the seller expressly
              agrees to assign to buyer the copyright in the delivered work. All transfer and assignment of intellectual property to buyer shall be subject to full payment for the
              narration and the delivery may not be used if payment is cancelled for any reason. For removal of doubt, in custom created work (such as a narration or translation etc.),
              the delivered work shall be the exclusive property of buyer, and seller assigns all rights, title and interest in the delivered work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sellers further confirm that whatever information they receive from the buyer, which is not public domain, shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared or used for
              any purpose whatsoever other than for the delivery of the ordered work to the buyer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Furthermore, users (both buyers and sellers) agree that unless they explicitly indicate otherwise, the content users voluntarily create/upload to VoxSnap, including
              Narration texts, photos, videos, usernames, and any other information, including the display of delivered work, may be used by VoxSnap for no consideration for marketing
              and/or other purposes.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>8. Account Termination Policy</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              VoxSnap will terminate a user's access to the Service if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.
            </li>
            <li>
              VoxSnap reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright infringement, such as, but not limited to,
              pornography, obscenity, or excessive length. VoxSnap may at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a
              user's account for submitting such material in violation of these Terms of Service.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>9. Digital Millennium Copyright Act</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the
              Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification,
                  a representative list of such works at that site;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled
                  and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail;
                </li>
                <li>
                  A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
                </li>
                <li>
                  A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of
                  an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              You may direct copyright infringement notifications to our DMCA Agent at 940 Stewart Dr, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, email: copyright@voxsnap.com. For clarity, only DMCA notices
              should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to VoxSnap customer service through
              <a href="mailto:support@voxsnap.com">support@voxsnap.com</a>. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 5(D), your DMCA notice may not be valid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner,
              the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Your physical or electronic signature;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
                </li>
                <li>
                  A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in San Francisco, California, and a statement
                  that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, VoxSnap may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed
              Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Content provider, member or user, the removed Content may be replaced,
              or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at VoxSnap's sole discretion.
            </li>
          </ol>
