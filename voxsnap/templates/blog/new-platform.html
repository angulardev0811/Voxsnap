<p><a href="https://www.martechadvisor.com/news/interactive-marketing/voxsnap-launches-new-platform-to-transpose-text-to-human-voice/"></a>Introducing&nbsp;a new solution, we&nbsp;enable marketers to&nbsp;<a href="https://voxsnap.com/">transform text to human voice</a>.&nbsp;We work with professional narrators to help companies transform written content into high-quality voice content, and engage audiences in a whole new way.</p>
<p>We&nbsp;also offer an <a href="https://voxsnap.com/audiohub/">extensive audio library</a> for consumers -- giving listeners a convenient&nbsp;way of enjoying great content on the go.</p>
<p>With the VoxSnap solution, companies can transform any written text -- things like white papers or blog posts -- into high-quality audio content. The audio can be embedded into blog posts, used as podcasts, with Amazon Alexa, or distributed through any other voice channel.</p>
<p>Listeners can access the informational content on topics such as technology, business, finance, marketing, health, and self-improvement, within VoxSnap&rsquo;s own online library. The library is accessible on web, mobile, and Amazon Alexa.</p>
<p>By adding an audio player into embedded posts, VoxSnap helps brands intelligently collect user engagement data.&nbsp;The platfrom then displays&nbsp;engagement reports to help companies optimize content marketing ROI, while obtaining a deeper understanding of customer acquisition costs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to make it easier for bloggers and companies to bring content to life with voice, reach relevant audiences, maximize distribution, and collect valuable engagement data. With so much going on in our lives, reading can be difficult to fit into our busy schedules. <br>By transforming more content into audio we hope to make information more accessible and consumable in our modern lives,&rdquo; said Helena Ronis, Co-founder and CEO</p>
<p>In recent years podcasts have skyrocketed in popularity. There are 67 million listeners in the US alone, and that number is expected to reach 112 million by 2021. For brands, this has come as a new opportunity to reach consumers and even described as the &ldquo;holy grail&rdquo; for advertisers, with podcast advertising revenues expected to almost triple from $237 million in 2017 to $642 million by 2021. VoxSnap is in a perfect position to facilitate this rise of audio content, and help brands provide interesting, educational content to consumers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to provide quality educational content for listeners to stay ahead in their industry and improve well-being. Thanks to our unique offering, we hope that VoxSnap will become a market leader in a world where voice and audio content is more popular and in demand than ever before. Our ultimate goal is to help companies reach more consumers while simultaneously providing enjoyable, educational content for everyone,&rdquo; said Ronis.</p>
