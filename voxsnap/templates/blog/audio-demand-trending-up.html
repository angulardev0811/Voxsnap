<p><a href="http://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2016/"><span>Research</span></a><span> shows that audio and podcast consumptions surge across the nation, half of Americans listen to online audio weekly.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="e995">No surprise, powered by the growth and increased consumption of smartphones which became an integral part of our daily lives. It’s tough to read so many articles and news nowadays, that’s why while on mobile it’s more convenient to put your headphones and listen to articles especially when you have those “lost” daily time slots during your car or bus commute, exercising, or even in the restroom ;)</p>
<p><span>If you can help your audience by making your content available in audio then people can just hit play and enjoy the ride, you on the other side will enjoy a greater ROI for your content.</span></p>
<p><span>Digital audio behaviors such as listening to online audio are achieving significant mass usage, according to the Infinite Dial 2016, the latest in a long-running series of studies on consumer adoption of digital media from Edison Research and Triton Digital.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The study, a nationally representative telephone survey performed to the highest research standards, finds that 50% of respondents age 12 and older listened to some sort of online audio in the last week, a rise from 44% in the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span>With 57% of Americans consuming online audio monthly, the conversion of monthly to weekly users is now 88%.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The study has become the report card on digital audio and other digital media and is widely used and quoted by broadcasters, Internet radio, ad agencies, and the financial community.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>When it comes to text-based content, it’s an established marketing strategy that many businesses already deploy. </span><a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2016_B2B_Report_Final.pdf"><span>Research</span></a><span> suggests that more than half of B2B marketers plan to increase their content marketing budget over the next 12 months. This means that content marketing is showing results and results are only going to increase with making the content available in audio.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="b001">Audio blogging also has significant implications for the $65 billion global audio sector that includes broadcast radio, recorded music, and on-demand streaming services. Until now, broadcast radio has dominated and on-demand audio has been a small piece of the pie, limited mostly to music streaming, that’s changing. </p>
<p><span>As audio blogging transitions to mass adoption, it can drive a broader shift from broadcast to on-demand audio that could put much of the $65 billion audio sector up for grabs and that’s why </span><a href="http://voxsnap.com"><span>converting your content to audio will have an impactful ROI for your business</span></a><span>.</span></p>
