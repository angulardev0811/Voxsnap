<p class="graf graf--p" name="5b8a">It’s tough to read so many articles, blog posts, and news nowadays.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="333b">In day-to-day life, there are these slots of time where you can’t really interact with text or read. Whether it’s when you’re on your daily commute, you’re at the gym, or while walking to and from work.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="faf9">As a content creator, you can make your content accessible in those time slots. Users then will have the choice between hundreds of songs that they’ve listened to for the hundredth time or articles about things that they’re interested in.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="a3d2">Also let’s not forget, by enabling your content in audio, you make it easier to consume for the visually impaired, thus opening a whole new set of customers that otherwise might not have come across or been able to consume your content.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="a3d2">Here is the trend, audio consumption <a class="markup--anchor markup--pullquote-anchor" href="http://www.edisonresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Podcast-Consumer-2016.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">increased 75%</a> in the past two years. People love listening more than they love reading, especially on mobile.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="b832"><strong>Thus to stay ahead of the curve and match demand for audio with your supply of content, you’ll want to make your content available in audio.</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="defc">The other benefit that you can get with audio is distribution via <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://voxsnap.com/audiohub/" target="_blank">VoxSnap</a>. You know how if you have slides you created, you probably want to upload them to SlideShare for broader audiences to discover and enjoy? Similarly here you can make content you already created available to the general public by uploading (we do it for you) to an <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://voxsnap.com/library" rel="noopener" target="_blank">audio library</a>, thereby increasing your post discoverability, consumption, and traffic.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="defc">Your audio will also automatically sync in car entertainment systems, which is the standard in most new cars.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="15a4">By giving users a way to consume your content on the go and on their smartphones, you’ll boost engagement and revenue, enhancing your content marketing ROI.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="1f68">In addition what you get is weekly analytics that give you insights into how people engage with your content, no more flying blind.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="24ba">With behavioral insights, you’ll be able to extract intel on what type of content people care about and what you should write more of, which content will convert your leads into customers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="24ba"><strong>Nearly all B2B marketers segment their content. With VoxSnap your segmentation will become richer and smarter.</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="fc80">We’re in the beginning of the “Audio renaissance”. Gartner recently predicted that by 2020, 30 percent of<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://v3b.com/2017/05/creating-audio-content-is-great-but-you-still-gotta-market-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> web browsing sessions will be conducted without a screen</a>, citing that “. . . vocal interactions extend the utility of web sessions to contexts such as driving, cooking, walking, socializing, exercising, and operating machinery. As a result, the share of waking hours devoid of instant access to online resources will approach zero.” That’s powerful.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="fc80"><a class="markup--anchor markup--pullquote-anchor" href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/siri-cortana-alexa-and-google-assistant-are-just-the-beginning-voice-is-the-future/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mark Samuels from ZDNet</a> also argues that “Siri, Cortana, Alexa and Google Assistant are just the beginning: Voice is the future” </p>

<p class="graf graf--p" name="16a2">Imagine one day you could ask:</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote" name="ee8a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“Alexa/Google/Siri, tell me about Product Management”</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="c451">It would play the best/most highly related articles in “Product Management” from VoxSnap.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" name="e467">Imagine if you’re a company or a blogger who creates content in Product Management or any other vertical, you will be able to easily reach people at their homes and commute.</p>
